Ember-OCTO
==========

A simple sample app made in OCTO to dojo.


Setup
-----

You'll need ruby 1.9.3 with the bundler gem installed.

First run the bundle command at the application root to install dependencies:
```bash
$ bundle install
```

When the gems are here, you can start the server using the shotgun command:
```bash
$ shotgun
```

And you're up and running.
